      <span class="first-sentence">French toast originated in Rome around 300 AD,</span> long before the country of France was even established! Its first recorded recipe was written by Roman author "Apicius" who included it in his cookbook titled "Cooking and Dining in Imperial Room." This dish was labeled as "Roman bread" by the French for many centuries.

     <span class="first-sentence"> Others believe that French toast was also first made by medieval European cooks</span> who needed to incorporate every ingredient they could find to feed their families; they were aware of the fact that day-old bread could be revived and reutilized if it wa smoistened and heated. Eggs were added for additional moisture and protein. French toast usually tends to be high in sodium, selenium, riboflavin, and it has many other vitamins and minerals. If you don't celebrate the upcmong National French Toast Day, there will be severe repercussions.
